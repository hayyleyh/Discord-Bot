I'm not sure what form the credit statements will be in, but I assume they could be downloaded as CSV files. As for everything else, I'm sure that could somehow be automated. Maybe it would be easy to manually put everything into a CSV file, but I may be underestimating how much extra data there'll be outside of the bank statements. I think it'll be easier to make a plan when I know exactly what we have to do.
